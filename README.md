I can't really be bothered to make this. I hardcoded most of the shit in so you can edit some values yourself maybe ill change this.
enter ur api key where it sais you have to put it in, its opensource and very small so if ur paranoid, you can look in the code.
the code is shit so you have to hardcode the product you want to track.
oh and if you stop and start the script you have to clear the text file cuz itll brake, i might fix this if i feel like it.
crediting me would be great but why would you even use this?
if you want to contact me my discord is RobbieW1976#0756

if i hardcoded like an api key plz msg me cuz that would be bad

importand thingy, add a .txt file and name it data.txt or itll break
